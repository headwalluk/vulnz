# WordPress Plugin

> **Coming Soon**

We will be releasing a WordPress plugin in the near future, which will link to the VULNZ API to automate website and component tracking.

This plugin will:

- Automatically report your site's installed plugins and themes to your VULNZ instance
- Keep track of plugin/theme updates
- Alert you when vulnerabilities are discovered in your installed components
- Integrate with your hosting provider's VULNZ installation

Check back for updates or watch the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/headwalluk/vulnz) for announcements.
